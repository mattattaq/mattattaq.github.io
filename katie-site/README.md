# Ignition4 Template
The ultimate goal is for us to recode Ignition from scratch using the latest coding standards.  
This includes being fully cross-browser compliant and to be working on multiple resolutions.  
Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Edge, IE11, Mobile, Tablet, Small/Large Resolutions.  

This repo will be used for the development of the Ignition4 Template.  
The main ignition4 repo is located here: https://github.com/CustomsForge/ignition4

# To Install:
* clone repo
* npm install

## SCSS:
[Sass SCSS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
For SCSS valid css is valid scss. SCSS is a meta language built ontop of css that allows the extension of css. Included files are linked to a master file `scss/styles.scss` and is compiled into `css/styles.css` which is used on `index.html` and are denoted with an underscore.

## JS:
Scripts are uglified into `scripts/scripts.js`

## gulp dependencies in chrome
[Live reload chrome browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)
This allows you to not have to reload the browser-- huzzah!
